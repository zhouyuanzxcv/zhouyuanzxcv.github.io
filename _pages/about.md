Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). Before coming to Fudan, I was a postdoctoral associate working with Prof. [Hemant Tagare](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/hemant-d-tagare) at the [Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/), [Yale School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering](https://www.cise.ufl.edu
), [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/) and [Paul Gader](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/gader-paul/). I received my M.S., B.S. degrees in Computer Application Technology and Software Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn).

My research in medical image analysis involves disease progression modeling for subtyping, interpretable machine learning for computer aided diagnosis, and medical image segmentation. Besides that, I have also worked on probabilistic graphical models in hyperspectral image analysis. My work has been published in IEEE Trans on Image Processing, IEEE Trans on Medical Imaging, Medical Image Analysis, Remote Sensing of Environment, IEEE Trans on Geoscience and Remote Science, etc, as well as conferences Information Processing in Medical Imaging, MICCAI, etc. 

I am looking for self-motivated (undergraduate/graduate) students to do research on medical image analysis. If you are interested in my work, you are welcome to contact me through email.
