Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). Before coming to Fudan, I was a postdoctoral associate working with Prof. [Hemant Tagare](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/hemant-d-tagare) at the [Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/), [Yale School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering](https://www.cise.ufl.edu
), [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/) and [Paul Gader](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/gader-paul/). I received my M.S., B.S. degrees in Computer Application Technology and Software Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn).

My research is focused on applying machine learning to solve problems in medicine and remote sensing. Specifically, I have been working on probabilistic graphical models and their application to medical image analysis and hyperspectral image analysis. My work has been published in IEEE Trans Image Processing, IEEE Trans Medical Imaging, Medical Image Analysis, Remote Sensing of Environment, IEEE Trans Geoscience and Remote Science, etc, as well as conferences Information Processing in Medical Imaging, MICCAI, etc. I have a broad interest in various areas in machine learning and its applications.

I am looking for self-motivated (undergraduate/graduate) students to do research on applied machine learning in medicine and remote sensing. If you are interested in my work, you are welcome to contact me through email.
