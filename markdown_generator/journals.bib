	abstract = {Urban composition can be analyzed through spectral unmixing of images from airborne imaging spectrometers. Unmixing given a spectral library can be accomplished by set-based methods or distribution-based methods. For computational efficiency and optimal accuracy, set-based methods employ a library reduction procedure when applied to large spectral libraries. On the other hand, distribution-based methods model the library by only a few parameters, hence innately accept large libraries. A natural question arises that can distribution-based methods with the original large spectral library achieve comparable performance to set-based methods in urban imagery. In this study, we aim to investigate the unmixing capability of several distribution-based methods, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), normal compositional model (NCM), and Beta compositional model (BCM) by comparing them to set-based methods MESMA and alternate angle minimization (AAM). The data for validation were collected by the AVIRIS sensor over the Santa Barbara region: two 16 m spatial resolution and two 4 m spatial resolution images. 64 validated regions of interest (ROI) (180 m by 180 m) were used to assess estimate accuracy. Ground truth was obtained using 1 m images leading to the following 6 classes: turfgrass, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), paved, roof, soil, and tree. Spectral libraries were built by manually identifying and extracting pure spectra from both resolution images, resulting in 3287 spectra at 16 m and 15,426 spectra at 4 m. The libraries were further reduced to 61 spectra at 16 m and 95 spectra at 4 m for set-based methods. The results show that in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), GMM performed best among the distribution-based methods while MESMA performed best among the set-based methods. For 16 m data, there is no significant difference between GMM and MESMA (MAE = 0.069 vs. MAE = 0.074, p = 0.25). For 4 m data, though GMM is not as accurate as MESMA (MAE = 0.056 vs. MAE = 0.046, p = 7e - 5), it is better than AAM (MAE = 0.056 vs. MAE = 0.065, p = 0.02) which is a re-implementation of MESMA. Further evidence on a reconstructed synthetic dataset implies possible overfitting of the reduced library to the images for MESMA. These findings suggest that the distribution-based method GMM could achieve comparable unmixing accuracy to set-based methods without the need of library reduction, it may also be more stable across datasets, and the current 2-step workflow could be replaced by a single model in applying a universal spectral library.1},

	abstract = {Combining a hyperspectral (HS) image and a multispectral (MS) image - an example of image fusion - can result in a spatially and spectrally high-resolution image. Despite the plethora of fusion algorithms in remote sensing, a necessary prerequisite, namely registration, is mostly ignored. This limits their application to well-registered images from the same source. In this article, we propose and validate an integrated registration and fusion approach (code available at https://github.com/zhouyuanzxcv/Hyperspectral). The registration algorithm minimizes a least-squares (LSQ) objective function with the point spread function (PSF) incorporated together with a nonrigid freeform transformation applied to the HS image and a rigid transformation applied to the MS image. It can handle images with significant scale differences and spatial distortion. The fusion algorithm takes the full high-resolution HS image as an unknown in the objective function. Assuming that the pixels lie on a low-dimensional manifold invariant to local linear transformations from spectral degradation, the fusion optimization problem leads to a closed-form solution. The method was validated on the Pavia University, Salton Sea, and the Mississippi Gulfport datasets. When the proposed registration algorithm is compared to its rigid variant and two mutual information-based methods, it has the best accuracy for both the nonrigid simulated dataset and the real dataset, with an average error less than 0.15 pixels for nonrigid distortion of maximum 1 HS pixel. When the fusion algorithm is compared with current state-of-the-art algorithms, it has the best performance on images with registration errors as well as on simulations that do not consider registration effects.},
